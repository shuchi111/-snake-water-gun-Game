# -snake-water-gun-Game
 TASK-  to develop your first-ever Python game i.e., "Snake Water Gun."

Most of you must already be familiar with the game. Still, I will provide you with a brief description.

This is a two-player game where each player chooses one object.  As we know, there are three objects, snake, water, and gun. So, the result will be 

Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.
In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be draw .
